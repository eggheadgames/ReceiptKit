Swift receipt framework to retrieve iOS app purchase date

This framework was built to help our iOS apps to extract their purchase date from the Apple receipt info provided in iOS 7 and beyond.

As you can see, it still lacks examples.

## Installation

### Carthage

Add this line to your [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile):

```
github "eggheadgames/ReceiptKit"
```

And run `carthage update`. You can find more info here https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#getting-started.
