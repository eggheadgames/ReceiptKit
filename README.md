# ReceiptKit
Swift receipt framework to retrieve iOS app purchase date

This pod was built to help our iOS apps to extract their purchase date from the Apple receipt info provided in iOS 7 and beyond.

As you can see, it still lacks examples, and the tests, sample project etc., were all provided by CocoaPods, though we declined those options.
